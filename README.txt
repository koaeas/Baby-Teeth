Baby Teeth

Baby Teeth is a children’s poetry collection written by Gregg Valentine and brought to life with whimsical, vintage-inspired illustrations. This project combines storytelling, visual art, and self-publishing to create a one-of-a-kind book that feels like a modern classic.

Published under Bound & Petal Press, Baby Teeth is the first in a series of creative works blending poetry and picture books.

About the Book

Baby Teeth is a collection of poems that explore childhood wonder, mischief, and imagination. Each poem is paired with hand-drawn illustrations in a sepia-toned, storybook style reminiscent of Shel Silverstein, Frog and Toad, and Little Critter.

The project began as a collaboration between Gregg Valentine (author, poet, filmmaker) and Ashley Valentine (designer, illustrator, and creative partner). Together, we set out to create a book that feels both timeless and contemporary—perfect for families, teachers, collectors, and fans of modern children’s literature.
